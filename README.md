# üß† Outlier-Detection-Algorithm
This repository contains two complementary Python implementations of a **time-series outlier detection algorithm** designed to be generalizable to any dense time-series data.

The method identifies outlier signals by constructing a **rolling geometric envelope** around an averaged reference trace, rather than relying on fixed statistical thresholds (like standard deviations or quantiles). The algorithm is **dynamic** because it adapts its geometric envelope to the local shape and variability of the averaged signal‚Äîautomatically adjusting the upper and lower limits based on the data‚Äôs real-time trends instead of using fixed thresholds.

In the real world, some systems need flexible solutions for dynamic problems. This algorithm represents one such approach. I had a clear mental image of what I wanted to build, but it took several iterations to translate that concept into code.

It renders the full rolling circle geometry used to construct the envelope, showing how each circular segment contributes to the final tolerance band.  This script is computationally expensive due to circle generation and rendering

## üöÄ Overview
This algorithm was developed for analyzing data generated from all kinds of sources and the approach is generalizable to any dense time-series data.  

The algorithm works by:
1. Computing an average trace from multiple aligned signals.
2. Building a **series of circles** along that average trace to form an envelope region.
3. Deriving upper and lower bounds (the top and bottom of the envelope).
4. Flagging any trace that exits the envelope as an **outlier**.

This produces a smooth, interpretable visual envelope that can dynamically adapt to nonlinear trends or noise while maintaining deterministic, parameter-based control.

## üßÆ Example
- Here we have a plot where we may want to flag specific curve(s) that deviate from the norm.  Notice the one peak around `time=12 (units)`.  Is this a curve we would want to flag?
![Plot with Atypical Curve](https://github.com/david125tran/Outlier-Detection-Algorithm/blob/main/Images/1.png?raw=true)
- We can compute the average at each time point **(blue line)**.  Crawl along on the rolling average to create circles to create an envelope.

- From the envelope, we can form upper and lower limits to figure out what to flag.

- We can then call the garbage collector to get rid of the circles to free up memory and we see our limits **(green circles)**.  Any curves thare are outside of the limits are flagged and colored as **red/pink**.

- And then we can control the width of these limits by changing the circle width.

## üß© Core Algorithm

**Input:**  
A collection of aligned time-series signals in tabular form (e.g., y-data vs. time).

**Steps:**
1. **Compute Average Curve**  
   - Calculate the mean y value across all traces at each time index (ignoring NaNs).  
2. **Construct Rolling Circles**  
   - Place a circle of fixed radius `width` around each average point, with optional interpolation between points (`interp_factor`) for smoother envelopes.  
3. **Derive Envelope Limits**  
   - For all circles combined, determine the **minimum (lower limit)** and **maximum (upper limit)** y-values per x-index.  
4. **Flag Outliers**  
   - Any signal crossing above or below these limits is marked as *flagged*.

**Output:**  
A DataFrame or Plotly figure showing all traces, the mean trace, and the geometric envelope with flagged outliers highlighted.
